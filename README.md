## Overview
This repository contains several VS c# projects that represent handy tools (applications) for managing OneNote notebooks.  

Note: Each project is in its own folder. 

Please bear with me as this section is under construction. I hope to have it done some time September 2024.  

## Tools Library
This project contains the OneNote library that is used by the other OneNote tools application.

## Search And Replace Tool
This project represents a stand-alone app that allows a user to perform a search and replace on a notebook. The scope of the search and replace is configurable.  

It should be noted that at the time this project was created, OneNote did not have a search and replace feature. 

## Link Validation Tool

This project represents a stand-alone app that allows users to validate internal and external links within a notebook. This is very useful when moving or curating repositories.  

Other third-party tools claim to validate links, however, I've found them to be severely lacking in both scope and delivery of functionality. Note: You can use the search and replace tool to bulk-fix links that are broken because resources have moved.
